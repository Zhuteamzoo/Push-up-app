# Push-Up Alarm App

The Push-Up Alarm App is a personal project designed to explore how technology can encourage better habits through physical interaction. The app functions as an alarm clock that cannot be dismissed unless the user completes a short physical activity—in this case, push-ups.

## Motivation

I noticed that many people, including myself, struggle to wake up effectively in the morning. Traditional alarms are easy to ignore or turn off without fully waking up, which often leads to oversleeping.

I wanted to explore whether combining physical movement with an alarm could create a more reliable and engaging way to wake up. This project became an opportunity to design a system that links **human behavior, computer vision, and software logic** to solve a real, everyday problem.

## How It Works

The app uses computer vision techniques to determine whether a user is performing a proper push-up. The alarm continues to sound until the app detects that the required movement has been completed correctly.

This required defining what qualifies as a “valid” push-up and translating that physical motion into measurable conditions the program could evaluate.

## Current Progress

- Implemented the logic to detect whether a push-up is performed correctly  
- Began developing the front-end interface for user interaction  
- Started integrating front-end and back-end components  

Some features, such as full back-end integration and user account functionality (logins and profiles), are still in progress.

## What I Learned

This project taught me that building interactive applications requires careful consideration of both technical accuracy and user experience. Designing reliable motion detection highlighted the challenge of translating real-world human movement into software logic, and reinforced the importance of testing and iteration.

## Next Steps

Planned improvements include:
- Completing back-end integration with the front-end
- Adding user accounts and progress tracking
- Improving robustness of motion detection across different environments
