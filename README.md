# Push Up App

- I noticed how hard it was for people to wake up in the morning

- So i decided to make an alarm that you couldn't turn off unless you did some sort of activity

- Where I am right now:
I have finished the code to detect if you're doing a good push up
Started developping the front end
X didnt finish implementing the back end into the front end and finish some front end details like accounts and log ins
